libplack-perl (1.0042-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
  - Fixes a mistake in the value of %D and %T in Accesslog::Timed middleware.
    This is due to a bug in Apache::LogFormat::Compiler that sets a wrong
    value for these fields. This bug has been fixed and now it emits what the
    documentation has always said, in the same way as how Apache's log format
    works.

    However, this is a BREAKING CHANGE if you are using '%D' or '%T' in your
    log formats, and you'll likely need to swap them if you need the same
    values as previously. Read https://github.com/plack/Plack/issues/549 for
    more details. (astj) #549, #551

libplack-perl (1.0029-1) unstable; urgency=low

    HTTP-Server-Simple-PSGI distribution

  In Debian, this is the package libhttp-server-simple-psgi-perl.

libplack-perl (1.0028-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
  - use HTTP::Tiny in Plack::Test::Suite and Plack::Test::Server rather than
    skipping it.
  - No XS! Eliminates dependency to LWP::UserAgent by making it completely
    optional for testing. If you run Plack::Test with Server implemenetation
    or run Plack::Test::Suite (for PSGI handlers) without LWP installed, the
    tests will automatically be skipped. This removes the eventual
    sub-dependency to HTML::Parser, which is the only XS dependency in Plack.
    #408

libplack-perl (1.0024-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
  - Deleted lots of code, methods and warnings that have been deprecated since
    0.99 (e.g. all of Plack::Server::*)
  - plackup foo.psgi will not search the file in @INC anymore before the
    current directory See https://github.com/plack/Plack/pull/343 for details
  - Plack::Request changes the way it parses QUERY_STRING for valueless keys
    such as "?a&b=1". Now "a" becomes part of query_parameters with empty
    string as its value

libplack-perl (0.9976-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
  - builder {} now always returns a PSGI code reference, instead of
    inconsistently returning URLMap object when mount() is used.
    (reported by hoelzro)
  - Plack::Runner now automatically calls ->parse_options() if it hasn't
    been called, so the sane defaults for plackup can be applied.
    (reported by arcanez)

libplack-perl (0.9973-1) unstable; urgency=low

  WARNING: CHANGES WHICH MAY BREAK YOUR APPLICATIONS

  In the past, Plack::Runner documentation provided a description of
  how to make a PSGI application executable as a standalone script, by
  recommending the use of the construct:

    if (__FILE__ eq $0) { ... }

  However, a change in Plack 0.9971 causes the $0 variable to now be
  localized to a given .psgi path when evaluating it in Plack::Util's
  load_psgi() routine. This fixes unexpected values and/or crashes
  with Starman when your application uses the FindBin module.
